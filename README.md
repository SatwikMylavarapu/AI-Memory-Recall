## 🧠 AI Memory Recall System
I built this AI-powered memory recall system to act as a smart personal assistant that stores and retrieves memories based on natural language queries. It functions like a digital second brain, helping users recall stored thoughts, reminders, and important notes with the power of AI and NLP.

## The Core Idea: A Thought-Based Memory Retrieval System
The system is designed to mimic how human memory works—when we try to recall something, we don’t just retrieve an exact phrase, but we contextually find the most relevant memory based on time, intent, and past thoughts.

For example, if a user previously stored:

"Remind me to submit my assignment on Saturday."
"I have a meeting at 3 PM today."
And later asks:
✅ "Do I have anything today?" → The system should retrieve "I have a meeting at 3 PM today."
✅ "What’s due this weekend?" → The system should retrieve "Remind me to submit my assignment on Saturday."

The AI understands context and retrieves the most relevant memories, rather than just performing a word-for-word search.

## Real-Life Applications
1. Personal Task Manager: Users can log important reminders and retrieve them anytime.
2. Voice-Activated Notes: It can be extended to work with voice commands for hands-free memory recall.
3. Smart AI Assistant: By integrating more NLP, the system could proactively remind users of tasks based on relevance.
4. Automated Journaling: Users can log thoughts throughout the day and later recall key moments.

## 📜 Project Overview  
This project enables me to **store and recall memories** using AI-powered **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I can store thoughts, retrieve them based on context, and even convert text to speech.

### Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB, Docker, AWS EC2  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **AI & NLP**: OpenAI Whisper, Google Gemini AI  
- **Storage**: MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier)  
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2 (Free Tier), **AWS ECR**, Docker, Streamlit Cloud

## 1️⃣ Setting Up MongoDB (Free Tier)  
I used **MongoDB Atlas** to store memory data.  

### Step 1: Creating a Free MongoDB Atlas Account  
1. I went to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)  
2. Clicked **Get Started** → Selected **Shared (Free Tier)**  
3. Chose **AWS (us-east-1)** and clicked **Create Cluster**  
4. **Network Access** → Allowed `0.0.0.0/0` (For Development)  
5. **Created Database User** → Added a username & password  

### Step 2: Getting the Connection String  
1. I went to **Database > Connect**  
2. Chose **Python** and copied the connection string  
3. Replaced `<username>` and `<password>` with my credentials  
4. Stored it in a `.env` file (Never commit this!)

```env
MONGO_URI = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/memoryRecallDB"
```

## 2️⃣ Setting Up AWS EC2 (Free Tier)  
I deployed my **FastAPI backend** on an **AWS EC2 instance (Free Tier).**  

### Step 1: Creating an EC2 Instance  
1. I went to **AWS Console > EC2 > Launch Instance**  
2. Chose **Ubuntu 22.04 (Free Tier Eligible)**  
3. Selected **t2.micro (Free Tier)**  
4. **Key Pair**: Created a new key or used an existing one (`.pem` file)  
5. **Security Group**: Allowed  
   - **SSH (22)** for remote access  
   - **HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), Custom TCP (8000) for FastAPI**  
6. Clicked **Launch Instance**  

###  Step 2: Connecting to EC2  
I found my **EC2 Public IP** under **Instances > Public IPv4**  

Then I connected using SSH:  

```sh
ssh -i my-key.pem ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>
```

---

## 3️⃣ Installing Dependencies on EC2  
After SSH-ing into EC2:  

###  Step 1: Updating & Installing Essentials  
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```

### Step 2: Cloning My GitHub Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<my-username>/AI-Memory-Recall.git
cd AI-Memory-Recall
```

### Step 3: Installing Python Dependencies  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4️⃣ Running FastAPI Backend on EC2  
### Step 1: Starting the FastAPI Server  
```sh
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
**FastAPI is running at:**  
```
http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:8000/docs
```

### Step 2: Testing API Endpoints  
I visited:  
```
http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:8000/docs
```
Then tested `POST /store-memory` and `POST /ai-recall`.

## 5️⃣ Deploying FastAPI Using Docker & AWS ECR  
I containerized my FastAPI app and pushed it to **AWS ECR**.

### Step 1: Creating an AWS ECR Repository  
```sh
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ai-memory-recall
```

### Step 2: Authenticating Docker to AWS ECR  
```sh
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

### Step 3: Building & Tagging the Docker Image  
```sh
docker build -t ai-memory .
docker tag ai-memory:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ai-memory-recall:latest
```

### Step 4: Pushing to AWS ECR  
```sh
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ai-memory-recall:latest
```

### Step 5: Running the Container on EC2  
```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ai-memory-recall:latest
```

## 6️⃣ Setting Up Streamlit Frontend  
I deployed the **Streamlit UI** to interact with the FastAPI backend.

### Step 1: Cloning Repo & Installing Streamlit  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<my-username>/AI-Memory-Recall.git
cd AI-Memory-Recall
pip install streamlit requests python-dotenv
```

streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 3: Deploying to Streamlit Cloud  
1. I went to **[Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)**  
2. Clicked **Deploy an App**  
3. Selected my GitHub repository  
4. Set **Secrets in Advanced Settings**:  
```toml
API_URL = "http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:8000"
```
5. Clicked **Deploy**  
6. 🎉 **My app is live!**
